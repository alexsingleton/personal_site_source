        	<h2>Biography</h2>
          	<p> I am a Professor of Geographic Information Science at the University of Liverpool and Deputy Director of the <a href="http://www.cdrc.ac.uk">ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre</a> (CDRC). Prior to this I worked at University College London as a researcher and is also where I completed my PhD. In a general sense my research is concerned with how the complexities of individual behaviours manifest spatially and can be represented and understood though a framework of geographic data science.</p>
			<p>In particular, this research has extended a tradition of area classification and I have developed a broad critique of the ways in which geodemographic methods can be refined through modern scientific approaches to data mining, geographic information science and quantitative human geography. I am an avid R user, and also advocate of <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2015.1137579">Open Geographic Information Science</a>.</p>
